# Key Features that Define Our Project

- This website is implemented using the MERN stack technology. Users can create a profile by signing in, and they also have the option to log in using Google and Skype. After joining, users can view published surveys and participate in them. They can also view survey results after participating.

- There are four types of users on this website: Admin, Surveyor (Editor), Premium member, and normal user. Normal users can participate in surveys posted by surveyors. They have the ability to like or dislike surveys and provide feedback to surveyors.

- Users can purchase membership on this website and make payments using their credit cards through Stripe. Once they become members, they gain the ability to comment on all published surveys.

- Admin can manage all types of data. They can view all users and appoint any user as a surveyor (editor).They can unpublish surveys and provide feedback to survey creators and can see access all payment information and survey responses.

- Surveyors have the ability to create, update, and delete surveys. When a surveyor posts a survey, its initial status is pending. Once the admin approves it, the survey is published for all users. Surveyor can see all survey resoonse and feedback those are given by admin and users.
